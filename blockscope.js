//CONCLUSION : var is Global Scoped AND let & const are Block Scoped that is we cant access it outside
//                              or
// CONCLUSION: 'var' is globally scoped, so it can be accessed outside the block. However, 'let' and 'const' are block-scoped and cannot be accessed outside the block.
